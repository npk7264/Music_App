Greatness as you
Smallest as me
You show me what is deep as sea
A little love, little kiss
A little hug, little gift
All of little something, these are our memories
You make me cry
Make me smile
Make me feel that love is true
You always stand by my side
I don't want to say goodbye
You make me cry
Make me smile
Make me feel the joy of love
Oh kissing you
Thank you for all the love you always give to me
Oh I love you
Greatness as you
Smallest as me

All of little something, these are our memories

Make me smile
Make me feel that love is true
You always stand by my side
I don't want to say goodbye
You make me cry
Make me smile
Make me feel the joy of love
Oh kissing you
Thank you for all the love you always give to me
Oh I love you
Yes I do, I always do
I always do
